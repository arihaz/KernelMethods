# Image classification with different kernels for SVM

This repository contains an example of image classification without using any machine learning library.
Different image features are built manually including color histograms and dense SIFT descriptors.
SVM and different kernels have also been coded from scratch, and thus are slow compared to methods implemented in famous toolkits.

Results and references are detailed in the pdf file.
